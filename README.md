## Requirements
* node `^10.15.0` (See `/src/package.json engines` field for **most recent** version required)
* Yarn `^1.13.0` (NPM CLI **not** supported)
* Docker `latest stable` *(Optional)*
* Docker Compose (manual install needed for only Linux) *(Optional)*


### Node

There are many ways to install Node and NPM. Recommended way to install is with using [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) (Node Version Manager) In this way you can easily install and switch between node versions


#### NVM Installation on OS X / Linux

You should run this in your terminal

    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh | bash

for more details and to get latest version, go: [https://github.com/creationix/nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)


#### NVM Installation on Windows

Just go on [nvm-windows repo](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) to see installation instructions
xx


#### Node/NPM Installation

First verify your NVM installation first

    $ command -v nvm
    nvm

which should output 'nvm' if the installation was successful.


### Yarn

Just go on [yarn website](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) and follow the instructions for your platform

Note: Ensure node already installed in your system and chose Yarn installation without node


### Verify Installations

Run commands below to ensure your installation was successful

    $ node --version
    v10.15.0

    $ yarn --version
    1.13.0


## Running the Project & Available Commands/Scripts

Type this command to install the required packages:

    $ yarn

After completing the installation step, you're ready to start the project!

You should run all yarn related commands inside ./src folder.

    $ yarn dev  # Start the development server

While developing, you will probably rely mostly on `yarn dev` however, there are additional scripts at your disposal:

|Command    |Description|
|-------------------|-----------|
|`yarn dev`              |Serves your app at `localhost:4000` [Development]|
|`yarn build`            |Builds the application to ./src/app/next|
|`yarn start`            |Serves your app at `localhost:4000` [Production]|
|`yarn lint`             |Lints the project for potential errors|
|`BUNDLE_ANALYZE=server yarn build` | Build and analyze the back end server bundle|
|`BUNDLE_ANALYZE=browser yarn build` | Build and analyze the front end browser bundle|
|`BUNDLE_ANALYZE=both yarn build` | Build and analyze both server and browser|
